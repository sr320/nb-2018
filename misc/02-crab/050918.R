#It contains all the good samples (20 ng/ÂµL or more RNA). I am wondering if there is a way to sort the rows based on treatment (warm/cold/ambient) and infection status (0/ 1) so that I can more easily visualize what I have within each category.

# A tibble: 3 x 2
#temperature_treatment count
#<fct>                 <int>
#1 ambient                  37
#2 cold                     33
#3 warm                      3

# filter data for ambient and inf = 1 and counts
filter(crab_big3, temperature_treatment == "ambient", infection_status == 1) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) 

# filter data for ambient and inf = 0 and counts
filter(crab_big3, temperature_treatment == "ambient", infection_status == 0) %>%
